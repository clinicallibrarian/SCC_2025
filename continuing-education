      <p>Picture this: a student sends an email to you looking for a specific article. You search for hours only to find out that the student found this article through an AI research platform. It’s fake. One of your most popular databases is promoting a new AI research assistant within the software, but they are not being transparent about how they utilize user information. Do these scenarios sound familiar? Then this course is for you. This course would describe how health sciences librarians can integrate their information literacy expertise into instruction surrounding AI in the context of research.</p>
      <p>At the end of the workshop participants will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify different types of AI platforms in order to prioritize content to instruct researchers</li>
        <li>Describe different stations of the research cycle in order to determine what level of AI instruction to deliver</li>
        <li>Articulate librarian expertise in education in order to successfully implement librarian interventions in research education</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Searching for evidence syntheses projects can be time-consuming. New tools are being developed to help in many of the processes, but it is difficult to keep up and learn about new tools. This course will provide an opportunity to learn about new tools to help across searching such as term finding, deduplication, translation of searches across new databases and platforms, grey literature searching, and citation chasing.</p>
      <p>At the end of the workshop participants will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Define searching standards using Cochrane MECIR standards as a checklist</li>
        <li>List tools to help with term finding and translating searches</li>
